# Godot HexGrid Demo (C#)

This is a small project to help build hexagonal grids using C# in the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Heavy inspiration from [Amit Patel's excellent guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) and [romlok's GDScript implementation](https://github.com/romlok/godot-gdhexgrid).
